# ChefYeshpal.github.io
Hiya, you may be reading this README and thinking... "why does this guy need a readme?"
Well, this is for you, cause I can :p

Jk, I'll tell you guys a bit about myself in here in case you're too tired to look up my website, I spent so many iterations on it... seriously, I've got an entire repository just for previous versions of the website (about 10 I think?)

So, without further ado:
- I'm Dhruva, not Yeshpal, that's my uncle who makes too good food
- I hail from India
- And I've been doing programming and stuff for the past 3 years.
  - Yeah I knew about programming and all even since before the 3 years, but 2 years ago I got my first laptop (a handmedown!) and that's when the coding journey really began.
  - Otherwise, I was just doing python programs like "moneymaker", it's got it's own repository as well you know?
- Legitamately I love mathematics, even if it makes me bald some times.
- I dont think you guys need to know anything more, other than I'm 18?

## As for why i've made this website?
well, it's mainly because I wanted to polish up my css and js skills a bit. My first website was a super simple html doc with the usual "about me" and "likes and dislikes" and "skills" sections. Now, it's wayy better in my opinion, but with each iteration I try to make it look different. Thinking it'll help me in getting a better artistic representation.

## For the SoM
I'm also participating in Summer of Making (by HackClub!), and so I've also decided to add my blog page as a project. Because I wanna write blogs about intresting stuff (like mendeleevs flower, and how to make it) while keeping it a simple read.
