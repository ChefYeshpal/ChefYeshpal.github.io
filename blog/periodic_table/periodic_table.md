# The humble Periodic Table...
Now, you may be wondering:
> "Raahhh! I've read too much about this crap! Yeah Mendeleev blah blah, Charles Janet, Theodor Benfy blah blah blah I KNOW IT ALL!!!"

Young one, you forget that there were many, and I really mean **many** attempts at making a periodic table... after all, it was a very difficult task to be able to arrange so many elements in such a way that it would not only be memorised, but also that we are able to group them together in such a coherent fashion that even a newly-blinded chemist is able to throw a dart and hit the element he wishes to.

And so, here I am, going to tell you guys about some unconventional, maybe funny looking periodic table's that were thought up of as an idea. Now, mind you that I'm typing this as I search for such tables and arrangements, so please forgive my inaptness in whatever you can.
