# How to Quickly Learn the Inverses Table Using Logarithms

## Introduction

Have you ever struggled to quickly find the inverse of a number? Don't worry! Today, we'll explore a **simple trick** that helps you memorize the **inverse table** faster using **logarithms**. We'll break it down so even a kid can understand. 🧠🚀

## What is an Inverse?

An **inverse** of a number means flipping it. We write it as:

\[ \frac{y}{x} \]

This means we divide \( y \) by \( x \). For example:

- \( \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \)
- \( \frac{1}{20} = 0.05 \)
- \( \frac{1}{30} = 0.0333 \)

But instead of memorizing all these values, **we’ll use logarithms to find them quickly!**

## Understanding Logarithms 🧐

A logarithm is the opposite of exponentiation. The **logarithm of a number** tells us **what power of 10 gives us that number**:

\[ \log(100) = 2 \] (because \( 10^2 = 100 \))
\[ \log(10) = 1 \] (because \( 10^1 = 10 \))
\[ \log(1) = 0 \] (because \( 10^0 = 1 \))

Now, the most useful rule for inverses is:

\[ \log(1/x) = -\log(x) \]

This means if we know **log(x), we can instantly find log(1/x)!**

## The Secret Logarithm Trick 🤯

Instead of memorizing fractions, we just need to remember **log values** from a log table!

| x   | log(x)  | -log(x) | 1/x   |
|-----|--------|--------|------|
| 10  | 1.0000 | -1.0000 | 0.1  |
| 20  | 1.3010 | -1.3010 | 0.05 |
| 30  | 1.4771 | -1.4771 | 0.0333 |
| 40  | 1.6021 | -1.6021 | 0.025 |
| 50  | 1.6990 | -1.6990 | 0.02  |
| 60  | 1.7782 | -1.7782 | 0.0167 |
| 70  | 1.8451 | -1.8451 | 0.0143 |
| 80  | 1.9031 | -1.9031 | 0.0125 |
| 90  | 1.9542 | -1.9542 | 0.0111 |
| 100 | 2.0000 | -2.0000 | 0.01  |

Instead of **remembering 1/x directly**, just remember its **log value**!

## Fast Trick to Memorize Using Logs 🧠🔥

### 1. **Use Log Tables**

Since **log(1/x) = -log(x)**, you only need to find **log(x)** in the table and **change its sign** to get the inverse!

Example:
- \( x = 30 \), \( \log(30) = 1.4771 \)
- Flip the sign: \( -1.4771 \)
- Find antilog: \( 10^{-1.4771} = 0.0333 \)
- So, \( 1/30 \approx 0.0333 \) 🎉

### 2. **Use a Simple Pattern**

Since values of \( x \) increase by **10 each time** and values of \( y \) increase by **1**, the pattern remains easy to track:

- **x = 10, y = 1** → \( 1/10 = 0.1 \)
- **x = 20, y = 2** → \( 1/20 = 0.05 \)
- **x = 30, y = 3** → \( 1/30 = 0.0333 \)
- **x = 40, y = 4** → \( 1/40 = 0.025 \)

Instead of recalculating, just **use the log table and apply the rule!**

### 3. **Quick Recall Using Log Differences**

Logarithms change **smoothly**, so if you know:
- \( \log(10) = 1.0000 \), then \( \log(20) = 1.3010 \) → difference **0.3010**
- \( \log(30) = 1.4771 \) → difference **0.1761**
- The differences shrink, making it easier to estimate values!

## Bonus: A Fun Story to Remember Logs! 📖

Imagine you are a **time traveler** 🕰️ trying to shrink large distances. Logarithms are like your **magic shrinking spell**:

- **At 10 km**, the magic shrinks it **10x smaller** → 1 km.
- **At 20 km**, it shrinks even more → **0.05 km**.
- **At 30 km**, it shrinks even more → **0.0333 km**.

Your spell follows a simple log table, so all you need is **one book of logs**, and you’ll never forget! 🧙‍♂️✨

## Conclusion 🎯

Instead of **memorizing inverse values**, just:

✅ Use the **logarithm table** to find log(x).  
✅ Flip the sign: **log(1/x) = -log(x)**.  
✅ Use the antilog to get the inverse!  
✅ Notice how the differences shrink to estimate faster.

By following this, you can **master the inverse table in no time!** 🚀💡
