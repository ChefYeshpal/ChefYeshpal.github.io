            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a student with a passion for combining code, electronics,
                and design to build practical and creative solutions. I have
                experience in Python, shell scripting, Arduino, and Blender, and
                I enjoy applying these skills to hands-on projects.

                    <strong>Quadratic Equation Solver:</strong> A Python tool
                    that solves any quadratic equation and shows real/complex
                    roots.
                </li>
                <li>

            <h2>Future in Environmental Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                While I haven’t yet directly worked on sustainability-focused
                innovations, I’m eager to apply my technical skills to such
                challenges. I’m especially interested in areas like water
                conservation, low-energy automation, and awareness through
                digital design. I believe hands-on tech and creative thinking
                can make a real impact in these domains.
