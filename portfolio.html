            <h2>About my projects</h2>
            <p>
	    	Most of my projects are open-source and can be viewed on my github, but there are a few that I have made yet havent updated (I dont have an excuse...), but will do so in the future. My learning material is mostly consisting of documentation by its author or youtube vids. I'll be making a specifc blog page for them most likely in the future.

                    <strong>Quadratic Equation Solver:</strong> A Python tool
                    that solves any quadratic equation and shows real/complex
                    roots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hydraulic Arm:</strong> Built a school project
                    demonstrating fluid mechanics and basic automation.
		    <p>It was mostly built using cardboard, plastic tubes and syringes. The main idea was to connect the syringes and tubes together, and be able to operate the crane/arm.
                </li>

                    <strong>3D Modeling:</strong> Used Blender to design basic
